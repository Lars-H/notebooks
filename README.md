To get started using the notebooks and run the notebooks, we suggest one of the following methods:
1. Follow [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Lars-H/notebooks/master) to run the Notebook on the Binder platform (recommended)
2. If you have a Google Account, you can also download the Notebook(s) and use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) to execute them
3. (Pro-User): Run the Jupyter Notebooks locally and install the necessary requirements on your local machine.
